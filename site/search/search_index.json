System Goals \u00b6 Radical transparency for public spending and institutional activity. Citizen participation in validation and oversight without sacrificing throughput. Government partnership with clear interfaces for budget planning, execution, and audits. Global interoperability via standards-based APIs and data schemas. 2. High-Level Component Model \u00b6 +------------------+ +------------------------+ | Citizen Wallets | <---> | Civic Engagement APIs | +------------------+ +------------------------+ | | v v +---------------------------------------------------------+ | Application & Integration Layer | | | | +--------------------+ +-----------------------------+ | | | Gov.

Stellar FBA Consensus Layer \u00b6 Fork Stellar Core to create a permissioned-but-open quorum configuration focusing on public sector validators. Node types Government Nodes : National, regional, and municipal computing centers. Citizen Auditor Nodes : Civil society organizations that meet staking and compliance requirements. Observer Nodes : Read-only replicas for journalists, NGOs, and watchdog groups. Enhancements Custom quorum sets for hierarchical governance (see Section 6). Integration with Soroban smart contract runtime for policy execution. Anchored time-series storage for budget line-items and contract execution proofs. 4. Soroban Smart Contract Suite \u00b6 Module Purpose Key Functions BudgetRegistry Tracks appropriations, releases, and obligations. registerBudget() , allocate() , obligate() , closePeriod() ProcurementLedger Records procurement events, bids, awards, and deliveries. announceBid() , submitBid() , awardContract() , recordDelivery() DisbursementTracker Links payment vouchers to budget items and milestones. createVoucher() , approveVoucher() , settleVoucher() AccountabilityScores Maintains transparency metrics for agencies and participants. updateMetric() , issueAlert() GovernanceVoting Manages proposals and votes for protocol upgrades and policies. submitProposal() , castVote() , finalizeVote() Data Invariants \u00b6 All monetary values recorded in Transparency Units (TU) , a non-transferable utility token. Each contract emits event logs referencing immutable document hashes stored via IPFS or similar content-addressable storage. Role-based access enforced by Soroban authentication interfaces tied to wallet identities. 5. Data & Document Layer \u00b6 Off-chain storage for large artifacts (budgets, contracts, receipts) using IPFS/Filecoin or compliant national data centers. Merkle proofs stored on-chain linking to document hashes and version history. Public REST/GraphQL API to fetch documents, anchored with blockchain transaction references. 6. Governance & Quorum Configuration \u00b6 Tiered validation roles : Tier 0 (Core) \u2013 National audit commissions, central banks. Tier 1 \u2013 Regional governments, accredited CSOs. Tier 2 \u2013 Citizen auditors with delegated stakes. Quorum slices require representation from at least two tiers to ratify a ledger close. Upgrade proposals submitted via GovernanceVoting contract with on-chain ballot and audit trail. 7. Identity & Access Management \u00b6 Wallet identities managed through DID-compatible credentials issued by government registries and verified civil organizations. Multi-factor authentication for operators (hardware keys + biometric or OTP). Selective disclosure: citizens choose what personal info is public; all audit-relevant data remains immutable. 8. Application Layer \u00b6 Government Budget Portal \u00b6 Secure dashboards for agencies to encode budget releases and monitor disbursements. Workflow engine ensures each action maps to an on-chain transaction (e.g., obligation, disbursement). Public Transparency Portal \u00b6 Read-only explorer for citizens with charts, alerts, and social accountability tools. Open data exports in CSV/JSON with machine-readable metadata. Civic Engagement APIs \u00b6 OAuth2-protected API for third-party watchdog apps. Webhooks for new procurement events, budget releases, or audit findings. 9. Observability & Compliance \u00b6 On-chain telemetry aggregated into Prometheus/Grafana dashboards. Regular Merkle root snapshots for auditing. Compliance workflows aligning with national procurement and auditing laws. 10. Security Considerations \u00b6 Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for validator key custody. Formal verification of critical Soroban contracts using property-based testing frameworks. Continuous vulnerability scanning of node software and infrastructure. Incident response runbooks with on-chain signaling for emergency shutdowns. 11. Deployment Blueprint \u00b6 Bootstrap genesis ledger with government and accredited civil society validators. Deploy Soroban contracts with multi-signature governance oversight. Launch staging network for pilot agencies and iterate on contract parameters. Roll out production network with phased onboarding of agencies and citizen auditors. 12. Future Enhancements \u00b6 Cross-border transparency data exchange via inter-ledger protocols. Mobile-first citizen wallet with localized languages and accessibility features. AI-assisted anomaly detection on procurement and disbursement patterns.
