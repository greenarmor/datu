# Project Mobilization Suggestion

This suggested mobilization agenda provides an early alert for stakeholders so they can prepare the governance and collaboration foundations needed before engineering execution accelerates. It distills the Phase 0 priorities from the DATU Implementation Plan into concrete prompts that community coordinators can act on immediately.

> **Status Update (2025-10-09):** Phase 1 engineering work on the Stellar fork has begun. Treat the activities below as the "Phase 0 backlog" to close alongside network development so the project can certify mobilization readiness as soon as the fork stabilizes.

## Immediate Mobilization Signals

- **Confirm Steering Committee Invitations**
  - Send dated invitations to citizen coalitions, civic-tech partners, transparency NGOs, and enabling public institutions.
  - Provide an onboarding packet containing the draft charter, expected cadence (weekly sync + monthly retrospective), and decision-making rubric.
  - Track RSVPs in a shared roster and escalate unconfirmed seats within 48 hours.
- **Launch Regulatory Listening Sessions**
  - Schedule at least two consultations each with legal/privacy, procurement, and data-protection specialists.
  - Capture emergent questions in a public tracker and assign a government or civil-society owner to each follow-up.
  - Summarize key risks and mitigation options in a briefing note for the steering committee ahead of the first sync.
- **Harden Collaboration Infrastructure**
  - Audit repository permissions, documentation onboarding steps, and CI/CD workflows; record findings in a checklist with completion dates.
  - Publish a short “getting started” guide so new volunteers can join sprints without friction.
  - Test incident response by running a mock “broken build” drill and documenting expected response roles.

## Two-Week Execution Checklist

| Day | Action | Owner | Evidence of Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Issue kickoff announcement summarizing the Implementation Plan and inviting stakeholders to governance sync | Project coordinator | Announcement posted to community channels |
| 2 | Confirm interim coordinators for consensus, smart contract, application, and compliance working groups | Steering committee chair | Names and contacts recorded in roster |
| 3 | Publish shared calendar, asynchronous decision log, and communication channels (forum + chat) | Collaboration ops lead | Links added to documentation portal |
| 5 | Hold first regulatory listening session; log questions and assign owners | Compliance liaison | Tracker updated with action items |
| 7 | Complete access review of repositories, documentation portal, and CI/CD | DevOps lead | Access report and remediation notes |
| 9 | Conduct mock incident drill on CI/CD pipeline | DevOps lead + working groups | Post-incident notes with lessons learned |
| 10 | Review governance charter and working group scopes in steering committee meeting | Steering committee | Approved charter published |
| 12 | Publish regulatory briefing note with risk mitigation guidance for Phase 1 | Compliance liaison | Brief uploaded to documentation portal |
| 14 | Circulate mobilization status report confirming readiness to enter Phase 1 | Project coordinator | Report distributed to steering committee and archived |

## Exit Report Template

Use the following outline when sending the Phase 0 completion update to all stakeholders:

1. **Overview:** Date, reporting lead, and summary of mobilization outcomes.
2. **Governance Readiness:** Confirmed membership roster, charter approval status, and upcoming meeting schedule.
3. **Regulatory Alignment:** Key findings from listening sessions, open issues with owners, and mitigation commitments.
4. **Collaboration Infrastructure:** Checklist status (access reviews, onboarding materials, incident drill results) and links to documentation.
5. **Risks & Mitigations:** Any blockers preventing Phase 1 kickoff and actions planned to resolve them.
6. **Call to Action:** Specific asks for Phase 1 contributors (e.g., validator nominations, contract requirement submissions).

These suggestions should be treated as guidance. Project leads can adapt them to local contexts while keeping the community informed about mobilization progress.
