# Project Mobilization Suggestion

This suggested mobilization agenda provides an early alert for stakeholders so they can prepare the governance and collaboration foundations needed before engineering execution accelerates. It distills the Phase 0 priorities from the DATU Implementation Plan into concrete prompts that community coordinators can act on immediately.

## Immediate Mobilization Signals

- **Confirm Steering Committee Invitations**  
  Circulate invitations to citizen coalitions, civic-tech partners, transparency NGOs, and enabling public institutions. Clarify expectations for weekly syncs and decision-making protocols so the committee can formally convene.
- **Launch Regulatory Listening Sessions**  
  Schedule open consultations with legal, privacy, and procurement experts. Capture emergent questions in a public tracker and route them to government advisors who can map compliance pathways.
- **Harden Collaboration Infrastructure**  
  Audit repository permissions, documentation onboarding steps, and CI/CD workflows. Publish a short “getting started” guide so new volunteers can join sprints without friction.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Publish a kickoff announcement summarizing the Implementation Plan and inviting stakeholders to the first governance sync.
2. Assign interim coordinators for the consensus, smart contract, application, and compliance working groups.
3. Stand up a shared calendar, discussion forum, and decision log to reinforce transparency during mobilization.

These suggestions should be treated as guidance. Project leads can adapt them to local contexts while keeping the community informed about mobilization progress.
