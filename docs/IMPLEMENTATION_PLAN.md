# DATU Implementation Plan

This roadmap outlines the key milestones required to turn the DATU reference architecture into a production-ready platform.

## Phase 0 – Project Mobilization (Weeks 0-2)

1. **Governance Mobilization**
   * Draft and circulate a steering committee charter that defines decision domains, quorum rules, and conflict resolution paths.
   * Confirm named representatives for consensus, smart contract, application, and compliance working groups; record their contact information and availability in a shared roster.
   * Schedule the first three governance syncs and publish agendas covering validator onboarding policy, risk management expectations, and milestone approvals.
2. **Regulatory & Risk Alignment**
   * Host at least two listening sessions with legal, privacy, and procurement experts to capture jurisdiction-specific requirements.
   * Open a compliance tracker (issues board or shared spreadsheet) that maps outstanding questions to accountable owners and due dates.
   * Produce a public-facing summary of regulatory constraints and mitigations to guide Phase 1 engineering decisions.
3. **Collaboration Infrastructure**
   * Complete access reviews for repositories, documentation portals, and communication tools; revoke unused accounts and enable MFA for administrators.
   * Publish contributor onboarding materials, including contribution guidelines, CLA instructions if needed, and a 48-hour response SLA for support requests.
   * Validate CI/CD pipelines with a dry-run build of the existing codebase and document the process for filing infrastructure incidents.
4. **Exit Criteria Before Phase 1 Begins**
   * Steering committee roster, working group membership, and governance charter are approved and posted to the documentation portal.
   * Compliance tracker shows all critical legal and regulatory questions assigned with target resolution dates.
   * Collaboration infrastructure checklist is complete, and a mobilization status report confirms stakeholders can join development activities without blockers.

## Phase 1 – Consensus Network Foundation (Weeks 3-10)

1. **Stellar Fork Preparation**
   * Clone Stellar Core and Horizon repositories.
   * Define DATU-specific network parameters (genesis accounts, quorum set policy, ledger close intervals).
   * Integrate hardware security modules for validator keys.
2. **Soroban Runtime Integration**
   * Enable Soroban smart contract support within validator nodes.
   * Configure continuous integration for Soroban WASM builds and tests.
3. **Testnet Launch**
   * Deploy minimum viable validator set (Tier 0 + Tier 1 organizations).
   * Publish public RPC endpoints for developers and observers.

## Phase 2 – Smart Contract Suite (Weeks 8-18)

1. **Specification & Modeling**
   * Draft detailed contract specs for BudgetRegistry, ProcurementLedger, DisbursementTracker, AccountabilityScores, and GovernanceVoting.
   * Define state diagrams, event schemas, and failure handling.
2. **Development & Verification**
   * Implement contracts in Rust targeting Soroban.
   * Write unit, integration, and property-based tests.
   * Perform third-party security review and formal analysis for critical invariants.
3. **Deployment**
   * Deploy contracts to testnet with controlled access.
   * Run scenario simulations with real-world budget/procurement data.

## Phase 3 – Application Layer (Weeks 12-26)

1. **Government Budget Portal**
   * Build React/Next.js front-end with secure admin workflows.
   * Integrate identity verification (OIDC / DID-based) and multi-factor auth.
   * Connect to Soroban contracts via Horizon API for transaction submission.
2. **Public Transparency Portal**
   * Create public explorer with charts, alerts, and downloadable datasets.
   * Implement search and filtering across budget lines, procurements, and disbursements.
3. **Civic Engagement APIs**
   * Design REST/GraphQL endpoints with OAuth2 scopes for watchdog applications.
   * Provide webhooks and SDKs (JavaScript, Python) for integration.

## Phase 4 – Data & Document Layer (Weeks 20-32)

* Integrate IPFS/Filecoin or compliant national data storage for large artifacts.
* Implement document hashing pipeline and notarization service linking to on-chain transactions.
* Build audit trail dashboards to trace document lifecycle events.

## Phase 5 – Governance & Compliance (Weeks 28-36)

* Operationalize tiered validator onboarding, including KYC/KYB checks.
* Launch on-chain governance using GovernanceVoting contract.
* Draft and ratify protocol upgrade and incident response procedures.

## Phase 6 – Security Hardening & Observability (Weeks 32-40)

* Establish continuous monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana and alerting runbooks.
* Conduct penetration tests and red-team exercises.
* Finalize disaster recovery and key rotation policies.

## Phase 7 – Pilot & Production Launch (Weeks 40-52)

* Run pilot with selected government agencies and civil society partners.
* Collect feedback, iterate on UX and contract parameters.
* Scale validator set, finalize legal agreements, and launch public mainnet.

## Deliverables & Success Metrics

| Phase | Key Deliverables | Success Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Governance charter, project tooling | Steering committee operational, documentation hub live |
| 1 | DATU testnet v1 | >99% validator uptime, ledger close time <5s |
| 2 | Audited Soroban contracts | All critical contracts pass formal verification and security review |
| 3 | Functional portals & APIs | End-to-end budget submission to public visibility demo |
| 4 | Document notarization service | 100% of test documents hashed and retrievable |
| 5 | Governance framework | Tiered quorum policy ratified on-chain |
| 6 | Security & observability stack | Mean time to detect incidents <5 minutes |
| 7 | Public mainnet | Pilot agencies onboarded, citizen auditors active |

This plan can be adapted as the team gains insights from pilots and stakeholder feedback. Each phase should end with a retrospective to refine subsequent milestones.
