# DATU Documentation Hub

Welcome to the documentation portal for the Decentralized Accountable Trust Union (DATU). This site consolidates the
architecture, implementation roadmap, and ongoing project updates into a single, easy-to-navigate reference for
contributors, partner institutions, and civic stakeholders.

## Documentation Structure

- **Architecture** – System overview covering consensus, smart contracts, application layers, identity, and security.
- **Implementation Plan** – Phase-by-phase milestones that translate the vision into deployable software and governance
  processes.
- **Project Progress** – A running changelog that captures repository updates, documentation improvements, and community
  milestones.

## Contributing to the Docs

1. Create or update markdown files in the `docs/` directory.
2. Run `mkdocs serve` locally to preview your changes (see the README for setup instructions).
3. Submit a pull request. The documentation workflow will build and deploy updates automatically when changes are merged
   into the default branch.

For broader contribution guidelines, architectural discussions, or implementation planning, explore the linked sections in
this documentation site.
